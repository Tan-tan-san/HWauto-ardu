Hot water heater automation written for a crude arduino setup

This project was created to be retro fitted to any hot water heaters that have a temp knob and that can be turned by a servo. The code includes a time range to turn it to 'high' or 'low'. Just to clarify the schematics, Fritzing didn't have a DS3231 part so I substituted the image with another. The wiring is still done the same.

BoM:
-Arduino nano v3
-DS3231 RTC and temp sensor
-g90 small servo motor
